# Esta_Keisha_FIP
This build consists of three mobile pages (from the site’s main navigation) and one custom desktop page designed to match the site’s look and feel for the FIP.  Key requirements: static CSS Grid layouts for both mobile and desktop, validated HTML with proper document outlines, consistency with the original Couple’s Resort design and content.
